# FitnessApp (Will change)

(App name) is a full-stack fitness tracking app build using React Native on the frontend and Flask (Python) 
on the backend. It allows users to log workouts and exerciss, with the goal of visualising progress and
eventually predicting progress using machine learning.

## About
This project was created to:
* Learn and apply Flask to build my own RESTful API
* Learn and use React Native to develop a mobile frontend
* Further practice full-stack development
* Utilise my data visualisation skills and eventually machine learning.

## Current Features

* Users can log a workout through:
*   - Workout name
    - Time Spent
    - Date
* Now the users can add multiple exercises to a workout, an exercise consists of:
*   - Exercise name
    - Weight used
    - Number of reps
    - Number of sets
 
* Future features:
*  - Auto filling previously done workouts using saved data
*  - Data visualisation
   - Machine learning
   - Potentially track the weight of the user and give them tips to their goals
